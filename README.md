### Why Gatsby.js?

- removes the boilerplate of configuring Webpack and optimizing fluid images
- fast websites by default with Google's [PRPL](https://web.dev/apply-instant-loading-with-prpl/) architectural pattern
- uses an orchestration layer for taming the Content Mesh and its many sources of data including third-party data
- automatically builds static sites that are Progressive Web Apps, follow the latest web standards and are optimized to be highly performant

### Flow

Netlify CMS provides Markdown data to Gatsby which then generates a static website that is deployed on Netlify.
