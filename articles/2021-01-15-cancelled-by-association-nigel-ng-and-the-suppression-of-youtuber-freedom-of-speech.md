Today, on the 15th of January, I began the day by clicking the unsubscribed button to comedian Nigel Ng's  - better known as Uncle Roger - YouTube Channel. When I did so, I was not aware of the #UnsubscribeUncleRoger movement trending online, but I am not surprised. 

Not wanting to bother you with details of what you might already know, allow me to just give a brief summary of the events that transpired. Uncle Roger made a video with fellow Youtuber Mike Chen - aka Strictly Dumpling - criticizing an Epicurious chef's dumpling making techniques. About a day later this video was removed from YouTube and Weibo (a video streaming service in China and YouTube alternative - as YouTube is banned in China).  The reasons for doing so were communicated on the Weibo platform - where Mr Ng's said that he was removing the video for the "incorrect" political views of Mike Chen towards the Chinese Government. Here is the problem with this.\

The YouTube video in particular contained no political views\

I was fortunate to be one of those who managed to watch the video in full on YouTube before it was taken down. Being an admirer (then) of Mr Ng and his work, and the Malaysian representation implicit in that work, I often watch his videos in a short period of them being released on YouTube. When that video was removed I had to convey my confusion as that was a comedy video about the correct way of making dumplings, nothing to do with any political decisions. The removal of a video for this very reason leads only to one other conclusion, the loss of freedom of speech by association.

Many of you are likely familiar that freedom of speech by association are a protected human right in some form or another in different jurisdictions. Furthermore, I think its fair to say that many see it as an intuitive right. I thus find no need to go into the details of the legal protections surrounding this human right. What I think is more fitting that I do is to explain the severe implications of such a precedent set by an influential YouTuber.

Ironically enough, Mr Ng just achieved over 3 million subscriptions just a few weeks ago, his latest video even more ironically being a video in celebration of that where he made fried rice of his own, to prove that when he criticizes chefs who make their own fried rice, he can walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Sadly, it seems that he can do neither when it comes to human rights. This latest video of his which was supposed to be a celebration of reaching 3 million subscribers is now filled with criticisms of his conduct, some from even his earlier fans who said they subscribed to him before he got famous.
